This is a modified version of the game CptnRuby included as an example with the [1] Gosu game development toolkit.

Little "improvements" were made:

 * added background music
 * several sound effects
 * a mini-map at the top right
 * a gem count and timer at the top left
 * a conclusion when you collect all gems
